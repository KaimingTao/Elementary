## Our sense collect data from the environment. In this internet world, the data are tooooo much

- things important are **information**, others are **noise**
- In network society, the data are tooooo much
- modern information system makes people expose to noises, it's deliberately designed like that
- before modern world, the issue was there too
- why way to know if noise exists, is to test if we're confused
- focus less on noise, it's wasting the time, and wasting the mind spirit, which will do harm to mind
- for different people what defines as **noise** are different
- we need to learn how to distinguish noise, and focus on what we really care
- Thinking about what we really want to achieve, we can learn what is noise and how to block noise
