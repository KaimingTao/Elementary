## Rules are tricks

- Rules are found by other people trying to model their knowledge
- When they play with their questions
- We learn it by play with our questions, not memorize it

## If what we see may not true, how can we know something is true?

- by repeated testing it
- I see run rise everyday so I know it will rise tomorrow
- I know without food I cannot live it's proved by history
- I don't know if extraterrestrial civilizations exists, because it's hard to prove, and for now, it's not important
- It's similar to when we cannot see things clearly we will try to see it twice or three times to confirm it
- things we can't repeated test is hard to be verified
- What other people feel we may not know anyway, but we can understand other people's mind by experience, or through their point of view, or reasoning
- Most of the time, we need make decisions even with incomplete information, and get incomplete information is common, complete is hard
- That's another reason we may see something not real, because the information is not complete
- All good products will be tested thousands or tens of thousands of times to check it's reliability

## Different perspectives and what could be true

- Our eyes and ears are faciing forward, that's why we cannot see our back and ourselves.
- The data we perceived is distorted by our sense
- Optical illusion is an example of what we see is not what's really happened
- Our mind will change the data we perceived
- A phenomenon called "selective attention test" shows we can ignore things when we're watching
- visual magic tricks is another example
- Different people see things in different angle, I call it `point of view`, it's a bit like the "allegory of the cave"
