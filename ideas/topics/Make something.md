## Thinker and doer

A common idea is that thinker and doer are different types of people.
Here, I introduce a new idea of what are their differences.

Simplest to say, thinker is focused more on the processing of data, less on generating
output. Doer is focused on doing something and checking it's feedback.

## What is Experience?

- Experience includes the historical data we sense, we think, and the things we have done
- Experience cannot be copied from others
- It's hard to explain something to people who lack the experience
- I cannot explain the taste of salted ducks I cooked
- I cannot recall the song I haven't heard
- We would hear other people's experience and knowledge
- But some details cannot be fully explained
- Personal experience is still essential for understanding
- And we need to know if the knowledge fits us or not (good or bad)
- Some people claim they know almost everything
- Comparing to 100 billion homo sapiens existed in history, it's just a drop of water in the ocean
- I cannot understand everything even for things I like to do
- I am limited by time and space
- But for things I care I want to learn more
- I'd be open minded to learn new things
- Some experiences won't have any consequence
- It's like passing through a stranger and we won't meet again
- In that way I'll rethink what I'm doing

## What is Think?

- Mind creates models which are simulations of real or virtual world
- Models don't have to fit what is real
- In physical world, the physics theories are good models
- In fictional stories, magics, humanoid animals, mythologies are using different logic
- Simulations help us predict what will happen, and make decisions
- Models, hence the **mindset** reflects how we see the world
- *Emotion is also one kind of thinking*
- High level (abstract) understanding is built from some basic understanding, that's what I call `level of understanding`
- If the abstract knowledge helps in real world, I'd consider it's necessary, otherwise I would say thinking too abstract things is not good
- I prefer not to build non-pragmatic abstract models
- Mind has limitations by time and space
- What's why we need focus on information not noise
- The purpose of thinking is to comprehend things and be smart
- But confusion is common, or say it's default, we start from unknown in learning process
- How mind works is a **solved** problem
- Some people think `how mind works` is an unsolved problem, but it's not
- Some experienced people they own knowledge of how mind works, they can predict other people's mind
- Yes, the biological details are not fully known

## What is Sense

- sense is for collecting data for thinking
- I use `data`, `knowledge`, `information` interchangeably
- human body can sense different kinds of information
- vision, hearing, tasting, smell, touch, comfort, humidity, etc
- vision and hearing catch our focus more than others
- sense can be complex and advanced
- there is a phenomenon called synesthesia when people hear music they can see colors, when see a picture of food they can feel the taste
- we can feel how we use our body, and how our body works in sports
- we can feel how we think, how our mind is working
- sense can distort what is real
- what we see is not always what is real
- different people feel same things in different way

## What is Action

- If we only think but do nothing, thinking is wasted
- we use mind to determine what is the goal
- we use mind to determine how to do
- trial and error is an efficient way to test our ideas
- there're multiple ways to do one job, but the costs are different
- travel from A to B we can walk, drive, take a plane, take a boat, dig a hole if it's on the other side of the sphere
- we shall estimate the cost and choose some of the affordable options.
- all action have consequences
- that help us make serious of choices if we should use one way or others'

## Perfectionist is not needed

to be better is not about to be perfect, it's about to be better than solve
the real question easier. the definition of perfect is always changing, hence
hard to be a goal. A goal should be a stable, reachable milestone, not a always
moving which cannot be caught.

## Be an active Thinker and do something.

## Learning and trying

- we learn things by experiencing and by do something
- I'd ask myself why I need learn this once in a while, to check my goal
- It's like asking `I do this thing for what?`
- If the goal is not clear, it's hard to see which way I'll walk
- A better way of learning I think is not memorizing things, it's thinking about how to use them in different context, and understand the logic
- Knowledge are not isolated
- Learning is a step by step walk
- Understanding advanced ideas requires some basic understanding
- That's why experience is essential for understanding
- Build yourself a handy knowledge library
- Any noting tools that cannot help us think is useless
- If we note a lot but won't use them, the notes feel sad
- We need tools that makes our mind clear, not a fancy tool which is misleading
- Learn from people's goodness and badness
- Know if they're knowledge is good for us

## Do things efficiently

- Work can fit into some workflows which constructed by steps
- Some workflows are efficient others are not
- Many inefficient big solutions at beginning is efficient
- After years it cannot fit new situations, people keeping adding things and forget cleaning up, some steps is not necessary anymore
- A workflow is a communication chain
- **If you understand how to communicate efficiently then you know how to do things efficiently**
- Make a plan, if possible some backup plans
