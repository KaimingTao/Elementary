## Learning and understanding

- We're in a period of time that we can access many information online, so learn something is easy?
- No. the internet is still lacking of many informations, because a lot of them cannot be digitalized.
- Or even it's digitalized you don't have the mind to understand them.
- The thing is we can have the goal to achieve the learning and solve our real problem, we go step by step small and small, one day we can finish the goal, that's the purpose of learning.
- The purpose of learning is not to memorize things and we won't use it definitely in the future.
- Although if it's your hobby, feel happy about learning it is a good experience.
- Of course to prepare some tools for future is not a bad idea like the regular school.
- We need driven by ourselves, or better lead by ourselves.
- Then we would be a psychologically independent person.

## Teachers help us pass some barriers when we don't know where to go, they have experience about these things

- it's high probably for things we're interested we cannot find a teacher
- so we rely on self study
- solving the problem by ourselves
- searching answers by ourselves

## Learn the self-learning

- wW can learn from books, videos, friends, families, etc.
- they may not realize the issue, if possible help them (it's hard)
- if they know their problem and don't change, then it's hard to help them
