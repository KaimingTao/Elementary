    - Notes which organized by project is better than organize then in topics, because project is our goal, not traditional topics.
    - For notes we don't know where to categorize it, save then using today's date.
    - Duplication of ideas is not a problem, ideas under different topics have different connotation, because the context are different.

    - You don't have to keep the NAS 24/7, only when you need it
    - Don't use big disk like 10T+, the problems is mirroring the disk is slow, and when a harddisk is broken, you need waste hours to rebuild it from new one.

    - I don't know if extraterrestrial civilizations exists, because it's hard to prove, and for now, it's not important
    - It's similar to when we cannot see things clearly we will try to see it twice or three times to confirm it
    - things we can't repeated test is hard to be verified
    - What other people feel we may not know anyway, but we can understand other people's mind by experience, or through their point of view, or reasoning
    - Most of the time, we need make decisions even with incomplete information, and get incomplete information is common, complete is hard
    - That's another reason we may see something not real, because the information is not complete

    - No. the internet is still lacking of many informations, because a lot of them cannot be digitalized.
    - Or even it's digitalized you don't have the mind to understand them.
    - The thing is we can have the goal to achieve the learning and solve our real problem, we go step by step small and small, one day we can finish the goal, that's the purpose of learning.
    - The purpose of learning is not to memorize things and we won't use it definitely in the future.
    - Although if it's your hobby, feel happy about learning it is a good experience.
    - Of course to prepare some tools for future is not a bad idea like the regular school.
    - We need driven by ourselves, or better lead by ourselves.

    - A better way of learning I think is not memorizing things, it's thinking about how to use them in different context, and understand the logic
    - Knowledge are not isolated
    - Learning is a step by step walk
    - Understanding advanced ideas requires some basic understanding
    - That's why experience is essential for understanding
    - Build yourself a handy knowledge library
    - Any noting tools that cannot help us think is useless
    - If we note a lot but won't use them, the notes feel sad

    - Experience cannot be copied from others
    - It's hard to explain something to people who lack the experience
    - I cannot explain the taste of salted ducks I cooked
    - I cannot recall the song I haven't heard
    - We would hear other people's experience and knowledge
    - But some details cannot be fully explained
    - Personal experience is still essential for understanding
    - And we need to know if the knowledge fits us or not (good or bad)
    - Some people claim they know almost everything
    - Comparing to 100 billion homo sapiens existed in history, it's just a drop of water in the ocean
    - I cannot understand everything even for things I like to do
    - I am limited by time and space
    - But for things I care I want to learn more
    - I'd be open minded to learn new things
    - Some experiences won't have any consequence
    - It's like passing through a stranger and we won't meet again
    - In that way I'll rethink what I'm doing

  details: |
    - Mind creates models which are simulations of real or virtual world
    - Models don't have to fit what is real
    - In physical world, the physics theories are good models
    - In fictional stories, magics, humanoid animals, mythologies are using different logic
    - Simulations help us predict what will happen, and make decisions
    - Models, hence the **mindset** reflects how we see the world
    - *Emotion is also one kind of thinking*
    - High level (abstract) understanding is built from some basic understanding, that's what I call `level of understanding`
    - If the abstract knowledge helps in real world, I'd consider it's necessary, otherwise I would say thinking too abstract things is not good
    - I prefer not to build non-pragmatic abstract models
    - Mind has limitations by time and space
    - What's why we need focus on information not noise
    - The purpose of thinking is to comprehend things and be smart
    - But confusion is common, or say it's default, we start from unknown in learning process
    - How mind works is a **solved** problem
    - Some people think `how mind works` is an unsolved problem, but it's not
    - Some experienced people they own knowledge of how mind works, they can predict other people's mind
    - Yes, the biological details are not fully known

- title: What is Sense
  details: |
    - sense is for collecting data for thinking
    - I use `data`, `knowledge`, `information` interchangeably
    - human body can sense different kinds of information
    - vision, hearing, tasting, smell, touch, comfort, humidity, etc
    - vision and hearing catch our focus more than others
    - sense can be complex and advanced
    - there is a phenomenon called synesthesia when people hear music they can see colors, when see a picture of food they can feel the taste
    - we can feel how we use our body, and how our body works in sports
    - we can feel how we think, how our mind is working
    - sense can distort what is real
    - what we see is not always what is real
    - different people feel same things in different way

- title: What is Action
  details: |
    - If we only think but do nothing, thinking is wasted
    - we use mind to determine what is the goal
    - we use mind to determine how to do
    - trial and error is an efficient way to test our ideas
    - there're multiple ways to do one job, but the costs are different
    - travel from A to B we can walk, drive, take a plane, take a boat, dig a hole if it's on the other side of the sphere
    - we shall estimate the cost and choose some of the affordable options.
    - all action have consequences
    - that help us make serious of choices if we should use one way or others'

- title: Some good ways of thinking
  details: |
    - have fun of thinking something interesting
    - don't be afraid of things you cannot understand
    - split hard questions to simple things you can understand
    - hard things are built up like lego pieces
    - try to be relax and calm
    - if the mind is always in tension, soon the burnout occurs and damage the mind
    - try to be analytical to the issue you're facing
    - Thinking about the consequence if we do or don't do something
    - is the thing we wanna do important?
    - is the consequence important?
    - learn from others their goodness and badness
    - be open minded

- title: Our sense collect data from the environment. In this internet world, the data are tooooo much
  details: |
    - things important are **information**, others are **noise**
    - In network society, the data are tooooo much
    - modern information system makes people expose to noises, it's deliberately designed like that
    - before modern world, the issue was there too
    - why way to know if noise exists, is to test if we're confused
    - focus less on noise, it's wasting the time, and wasting the mind spirit, which will do harm to mind
    - for different people what defines as **noise** are different
    - we need to learn how to distinguish noise, and focus on what we really care
    - Thinking about what we really want to achieve, we can learn what is noise and how to block noise

  details: |
    Our character shapes both our thoughts and our actions. Our actions, in turn, reveal our mindset LOOP. We can help us by knowing ourselves. We can only help people who know themselves. It's very hard to help people who refuse to see themselves. Kind of impossible.
