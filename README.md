# Elementary

Idea collections for thinking.



## YAML workflow

Code are generated by codex


- Edit your card content in `data/cards.yaml` using keys: `title`, `summary`, `details`, `tags`, and optional `image` blocks with `src`/`alt`.
- Install the converter dependency once with `pip install pyyaml`.
- Run `data/yaml2json.py` to regenerate `data/cards.json`:
  - `./data/yaml2json.py` converts the default YAML file.
  - Use `./data/yaml2json.py -i path/to/input.yaml -o data/cards.json` to target custom paths.
- Provide tags as a YAML list (recommended) or a delimited string; the default delimiter is `,`.
- Omit the `image` key to drop the image block from the output JSON.

## Rationale

The goal of this project is to make life meaningful.

In the complicated world, life is not simple, is it possible to **make things a bit easier, understandable, controllable?**, then we can have some fun.

Things are complicated because things can go in diferent ways, and the number is large. As our mind are trying to model real world situations, we're trying to think many possibilities from different aspects, then something would reach beyond our minds' capability, and that feels hard. **Do some easier way exists?**, yes, some simple thinking tools can help us. For example we can ask **What is important information?**.

I find some elementary thinking tools from real life experience, based on them I can build tools to solve real world questions. I'd like to share with you and hope they can **help you build your thinking tools**.

My goal is to provide a simple guideline that is easy to understand and follow. I'm trying to make it concise and communicate efficiently. Each thinking tool contains two parts, the main part contains key points for quick check, the attached link as second part describe reasons in detail you can check if you want.

Another reason I make things simple is, there's no universal way. Knowledge is scattered everywhere. Ubiquitous theorise is too faraway to be used to achive real-world goals, if they really exits. As long as tricks work, it's good.

There're many different ways to see these thinking tools. I'll try to illustrate them in different media. It helps me see things in different angles and refine them, second it trains my skill of communicating concisely. Balancing them simple for understanding is hard, I'll try.

## Epilogue

I feel text can express things simply but some of the ideas if I want to add them will make things more complex. Keep these ideas simple is hard, missing background information makes them hard to be understood, adding more information has similar problem. I'm trying other medias.
